# Scheduler-Study Assistant

The 'Scheduler-StudyAssistant' is a web based time schedule management system for students. Built as part of my final project for the CS5ox online course offered by the Harvard University, this system assists students in the following ways:-

* It creates customized study schedules based on students' modules
* It provides detailed analysis about modules based on data collected from students
* It provide reports about the progress of student
* It notifies and record study session related data from students

Note:
I built this web application under the guidance of a computer science professor.
